# Research

This directory is for researching and documenting the capabilities of popular AI-based development tools/platforms (e.g. OpenSpec, claude-flow, etc.).  It is used to inform the design of the personal development workflow.

## Example Prompt

```
Research oh-my-opencode-slim (https://github.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim ).  Give an overall summary, purpose, capabilities/features, popularity, or any custom agents/commands/skills.  Create a section that talks about how this tool might support and integrate with my personal development workflow that has these goals: @GOALS.md   Which goals might it support, and which might it not?

Add a section that captures future features/direction, either pulled from README documents, an explicit Roadmap document, or from Github Discussion/Wiki.  If none of those exist, then infer from pending PRs or recent commits that suggest upcoming features.  If still nothing, then just say "No roadmap or future features are documented."

Add anything else that might be interesting or relevant?

Write out your findings to a new document:  `research/oh-my-opencode-slim.md`.  Provide all important and relevant details, but keep it concise (not too concise).
```
