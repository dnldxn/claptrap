# src/ — AI Agent Instructions

This directory contains installable workflow artifacts. When editing files here:

- **Target audience**: These files will be used in other projects after installation.
- **Relative paths**: Use paths relative to the installed location (e.g., `skills/memory/SKILL.md`), not this repo's root.
- **Provider-agnostic**: Avoid provider-specific features; adapters handle differences.
- **Self-contained**: Each agent/command/skill should work independently with minimal dependencies.

For repo-level guidance (contributing, structure decisions), see the root `/AGENTS.md`.
