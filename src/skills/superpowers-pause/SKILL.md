description: Pause all activity and write a RESUME.md file for later continuation.
---

The implementation process will need to be interrupted and restarted later. Write out a detailed summary of what we've done so far and what still needs to be done so that another agent can resume EXACTLY where we are with enough context to continue. Write this out to a `RESUME.md` file in the project root. If the file already exists, overwrite it. Then, pause all activity and wait for further instructions.
