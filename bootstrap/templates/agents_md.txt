# Core Principles
- **Simple over Clever**: Always favor the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Minimal Complexity**: Reduce moving parts, dependencies, and abstractions to the essential minimum.
- **Code Quality**: Write maintainable, self-documenting code; follow DRY principles for significant duplications (don't obsess over minor repetition)
- **Minimal Error Handling**: Handle only external failures; trust internal code
- **Conciseness**: Make the minimum necessary changes to achieve the goal.
- **Confident**: Make clear recommendations rather than presenting multiple options
- **Trust your own code**: Save error handling for external boundaries

# Project Rules
- **BEFORE** you start any work, you are **strictly required** to list all available Skills, then load any that are relevant to the task at hand.  If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.  IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.  This is not optional.
- If anything is unclear, ask the user for clarification until satisfied. Do not proceed until you have a clear understanding of the requirements.
- Instructions that are directly provided should supersede any other instructions loaded later. 

# Project Code Conventions / Style Guides
You are **strictly required** to read and adhere to the project code conventions in the `.workflow/code-conventions/` directory.

- For Python code, the conventions are in `.workflow/code-conventions/python.md`.
- For Snowflake SQL code (including SQL in Python files), the conventions are in `.workflow/code-conventions/snowflake.md`.
