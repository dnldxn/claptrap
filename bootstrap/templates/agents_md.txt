# Global AI Rules (Canonical)

## Non-negotiables (Stop-gates).  These are **NOT** optional.

1) If any requirement is unclear or conflicting, STOP and ask questions before acting.
2) Before making edits, identify the available agent tools/features for this environment (tools/skills/rules/agents/commands) and use the relevant ones.
3) When writing code in a language listed below, you are **strictly required** to read and adhere to the corresponding file in `.claptrap/code-conventions/`. If the file doesn't exist, ask where to find it (don't guess).
   - Python: `python.md`
   - Snowflake SQL (including SQL embedded in other languages): `snowflake.md`

## Core Coding Principles
- **Simple over Clever**: Always favor the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Minimal Complexity**: Reduce moving parts, dependencies, and abstractions to the essential minimum.
- **Code Quality**: Write maintainable, self-documenting code; follow DRY principles for significant duplications (don't obsess over minor repetition)
- **Minimal Error Handling**: Handle only external failures; trust internal code
- **Conciseness**: Make the minimum necessary changes to achieve the goal.
- **Confident**: Make clear recommendations rather than presenting multiple options
- **Trust your own code**: Save error handling for external boundaries

## Misc
- If available, ask context7 MCP for updated technical documentation when using a new library, framework, or tool
