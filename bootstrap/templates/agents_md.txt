# Non-negotiables (Stop-gates).  These are **NOT** optional.

1) If any requirement is unclear or conflicting, STOP and ask questions before acting.
2) Before making edits, identify the available agent tools/features for this environment (tools/skills/rules/agents/commands) and use the relevant ones.
3) Before writing or modifying code in the following languages, you must read and follow the corresponding style guide in `<PROJECTROOT>/.claptrap/code-conventions/` and confirm you've loaded it. If you can't find it, STOP and ask (don't guess).
   - Python: `python.md`
   - Snowflake SQL (including SQL embedded in other languages): `snowflake.md`
4) Before you do anything, load the `claptrap-memory` skill and follow its instructions. This will enable you to read and write persistent memories.

# Core Coding Principles
- **Simple over Clever**: Always favor the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Minimal Complexity**: Reduce moving parts, dependencies, and abstractions to the essential minimum.
- **Code Quality**: Write maintainable, self-documenting code; follow DRY principles for significant duplications (don't obsess over minor repetition)
- **Minimal Error Handling**: Only handle failures at the external boundaries; trust internal code
- **Conciseness**: Make the minimum necessary changes to achieve the goal.
- **Confident**: Make clear recommendations rather than presenting multiple options

# Tool Usage
- If available, use the Serena MCP server for planning and implementation.
- If available, ask context7 MCP for updated technical documentation when using a new library, framework, or tool
- If available, use the `AskUserTool`, `AskUserQuestion`, `question`, or similar to ask user questions

# Project Roadmap
- After completing a design doc or implementation plan, load the
  `claptrap-roadmap` skill and update `docs/plans/ROADMAP.md`.
- After completing implementation tasks, update the roadmap to
  reflect progress.
- The roadmap should stay concise - feature-level items only.
